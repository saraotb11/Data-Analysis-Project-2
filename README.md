README - Diabetes Prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes
Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of Gaussian Naive Bayes for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical predictor variables. The analysis involves data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the prediction results.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetesdatabase)
Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to implement the project:
• pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• numpy: For numerical operations.
• scikit-learn: For machine learning model training,
data splitting, and evaluation.

Steps Performed
1. Data Loading: Loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and check for missing values.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing or zero values by replacing them with the median for relevant columns.
3. Model Training: Training the Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the dataset after splitting it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. A classification report is generated to summarize the performance.
5. Results Interpretation: Presenting the evaluation metrics and analyzing the model’s predictive power for diabetes diagnosis





README - Market Basket Analysis on E-commerce Dataset
Project Description
This project performs market basket analysis using an e- commerce dataset. The goal is to identify the most frequently ordered products and the associations between them using association rule mining techniques. The analysis includes data loading, preprocessing, frequent itemset analysis, and visualization of the association rules.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Market Basket Analysis on E-commerce Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to implement the project:
• pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• apyori: For performing market basket analysis.
• matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
 
 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading: Loading data from the olist_order_items_dataset.csv, olist_orders_dataset.csv, and olist_products_dataset.csv files and checking for missing values.
2. Data Preparation: Merging the datasets, grouping products by their IDs, and counting their occurrences to analyze the most frequently ordered products.
3. Top 10 Products Visualization: Visualizing the top 10 most frequently ordered products using a bar chart.
4. Market Basket Analysis: Using the apyori library to perform association rule mining, identifying frequent itemsets and the associations between products.
5. Visualization of Association Rules: Displaying the association rules using a bubble chart, where the size of the bubble represents the lift, and the x and y axes represent support and confidence, respectively.


README-Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset
Project Description
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon fine food reviews. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the reviews (positive or negative) using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, .exploratory data analysis (EDA), and text classification
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
Libraries Used:
The following libraries were used to implement the project • pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• nltk: For natural language processing and text preprocessing.
• scikit-learn : For machine learning model building and evaluation.
• matplotlib: For data visualization.
• wordcloud: For generating word clouds to visualize word frequency.
 
 Steps Performed:
